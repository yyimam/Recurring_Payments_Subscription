SIMPLE TRANSACTION USING BRAINTREE:
video link I'm following for this = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VLKmN7wL0o&t=1680s

- UI:
    - copy paste form and javascript from above git repo. an error should occur of "Undefined variable: gateway", it's coming because is script tag we are trying to access a $gateway("<?php echo($gateway->ClientToken()->generate()); ?>") which doesn't exists. So in next step we're going to resolve it.

    - Resolve Error:
        - in repo file $gateway is getting accessed from ".\includes\braintree_init.php" so we are going to copy things from there in our route.

        - make route like this:
            Route::get('simple-transaction', function () {

                // in config func. services.braintree values are coming from config/services.php
                $gateway = new Braintree\Gateway([
                    'environment' => config('services.braintree.environment'),
                    'merchantId' => config('services.braintree.merchantId'),
                    'publicKey' => config('services.braintree.publicKey'),
                    'privateKey' => config('services.braintree.privateKey')
                ]);

                $token = $gateway->ClientToken()->generate();

                return view('simpleTransaction', [
                    'token' => $token
                ]);
            });

    - In above route we are passing that value from the route that in repo project was providing by variable $gateway. and in our case $token contain that value, so let's replace $gateway with $token in our view(ui).

    - replace `var client_token = "<?php echo($gateway->ClientToken()->generate()); ?>"; ` with `var client_token = "{{ $token }}";`. And this should work and bring braintree payment methods.

- BACKEND:
    - now let's create backend functionalities for this UI. it's backend is located in repo's public_html/checkout.php, copy it's code to a new route and make some changes.

    - use this code, either in route or in controller, it's your choice
